# E-Commerce-Website-in-Perl
This website allows people to buy and sell physical goods, services, and digital products over the internet rather than at a brick-and-mortar location. Through an e-commerce website, a business can process orders, accept payments, manage shipping and logistics, and provide customer service. There are three main types of e-commerce: business-to-business (websites such as Shopify), business-to- consumer (websites such as Amazon), and consumer-to-consumer (websites such as eBay).
